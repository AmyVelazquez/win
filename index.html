                    <p>UX leaders often talk about the importance of <em>“having a seat at the table.”</em> However,
                        what’s more
                        critical is <em>what we bring to the table.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>Right now, your organization faces vital decisions. Decisions that will determine whether the
                        future
                        results in delivering great products or mediocre ones. Decisions that will determine the best
                        way to focus
                        limited resources. If made right, they will delight customers and, if made wrong, they will cost
                        the
                        organization money and reputation.</p>
                    <p>When important decisions need to be made, do you have the data and insights to guide the
                        decision-makers to
                        the best choices? The data and insights are the product of advanced user research. It’s the
                        superpower that
                        UX leaders just like you can bring to the table.</p>

                        a plan

                    <p>Everything you learn in this 5-day Intensive comes directly from Jared’s years of working across

                    <p>Most importantly, you’ll love how much smarter you’ll feel after spending a few minutes absorbing
                        his
